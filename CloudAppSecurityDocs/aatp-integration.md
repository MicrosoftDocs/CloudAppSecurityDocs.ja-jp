*適用対象: Microsoft Cloud App Security*

Microsoft Cloud App Security integrates with Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP) to provide user entity behavioral analytics (UEBA) across a hybrid environment - both cloud app and on-premises, for more information, see [Tutorial: Investigate risky users](tutorial-ueba.md) For more information about the machine learning and behavioral analytics provided by Azure ATP, see [What is Azure ATP?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-advanced-threat-protection/what-is-atp).
